    "# Design goals\n",
    "- [ ] 1. Cheap\n",
    "- [ ] 2. Small\n",
    "- [ ] 3. Integrated (no external wires, no detachable modules)\n",
    "- [ ] 4. Safe (no exposed high voltage, no exposed sharp edges)\n",
    "- [ ] 5. Designed for manufacturing\n",
    "- [ ] 6. Low power consumption\n",

    "# Power source\n",
    "A single 18650 cell.  It should last longer than a child's attention span.  The cell will not be charged in the car, but removed and charged in a dedicated charger.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Battery protection\n",
    "The battery will be protected by a DW01A and FS8205A MOSFETs.  Up to three FS8205A can be paralleled to increase the current rating.\n",
    "These components can be salvaged from AliExpress modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MOSFETs will serve dual use as a power switch.  By using a PMOS to cut the power to the DW01A, it will be tricked into thinking that the battery is empty, and it will disconnect the battery from the load.\n",
    "\n",
    "To turn the car on, the user will press a momentary switch connected to the 2pin-header.  This will turn on the PMOS, which will power the DW01A.  This will turn on the FS8205A, which will connect the battery to the load.  Once the MCU is running, it should turn on Q3, so that the user can release the button and the car will stay on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To turn the car off, the user pushes the switch again.  This will pull down the GPIO of the MCU.  The MCU will turn off Q3, which will cut the power to the DW01A.  The DW01A will disconnect the battery from the load.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Boost converter\n",
    "The XR2981 and its inductor can be salvaged from cheap AliExpress modules.  It can be used to boost the battery voltage to 8.4V for the steering motor.  It should easily be capable of 2A.  The inductor might need to be replaced with a 3.3uH one.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Design procedure](https://github.com/LieBtrau/electronics-design-data/blob/master/circuits/boost-converter/boost-converter.ipynb),\n",

    "# 3V3 regulator\n",
    "The 3V3 regulator will be a XC6220B331MR-G.  It's easily capable of delivering the 300mA current peaks of the ESP32.  It's low quiescent current is of no concern, because the power to the battery will be cut when the car is not in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "# MCU\n",
    "## R1.0\n",
    "ESP-C3 would have been nice, but there's no support for Bluetooth-SPP, so the ESP32 it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "## R1.1\n",
    "Bluetooth-SPP is not needed.  It's Bluetooth HID that's needed.  That doesn't matter much.  The ESP32 is still the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Motor\n",
    "* Steering motor : 0.5A@3.7V.  \n",
    "* Driving motor : 1A@8.4V\n",
    "\n",
    "# Motor driver\n",
    "## R1.0\n",
    "The cheapest option is to build a H-bridge with discrete MOSFETs.  [EDN](https://www.edn.com/microcontroller-drives-piezoelectric-buzzer-at-high-voltage/) features a simple, high-current, non-protected H-bridge.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Current sense amplifier\n",
    "As 8.4V for the motor is actually too high, we might burn the little thing quickly, the motor current will be monitored.\n",
    "* The amplification is 2x\n",
    "* Low pass filter is > 20kHz\n",
    "* A diode is used to build a precision rectifier, followed by an averaging filter (R||C).  This should make it less critical to time the ADC-sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## R1.1\n",
    "The above solution might work well for piezo-elements, but it's not suitable for brushed DC-motors.  During the off-period, there is an instant in which the polarity to the motor is reversed.  I can't explain this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete MOSFET H-bridge (not chosen)\n",
    "By keeping the corresponding PMOS always on, instead of controlling it by the NMOS drain, this behaviour can be avoided.  This requires per motor direction a PMOS driver, which can be made with discrete components and an extra GPIO.  While this solution is cheap, it requires a lot of components and board space.  Moreover, the opamp will be needed to monitor the current.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrated H-bridge\n",
    "DRV8870DDA is small, easy to solder and cheap.  The current monitoring is integrated.  It requires at least 6.5V.  The steering motor will be driven from the 8.4V as well, but with much lower PWM-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current sense amplifier\n",
    "The voltage over the sense resistor should be between 100mV (lower = more noise) and 200mV (higher is more power loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use two 100mOhm resistors in parallel.  A motor current of 2A gives a sense voltage of 100mV:\n",
    "* The total power loss is 0.2W, which is acceptable.  \n",
    "* 100mOhm is a common value.  250mW/1206 is a common package.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Firmware\n",
    "* Ramp up PWM for the thrust motor slowly to avoid a current spike."
