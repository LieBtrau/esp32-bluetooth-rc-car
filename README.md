# esp32-bluetooth-rc-car
This repository actually contains two different projects. The first one is a Dune Buggy, which is controlled by an Android app. The second one is a New Bright Corvette, which is controlled by a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.

Both projects use bluetooth.  The Dune Buggy contains an ESP32 using a Bluetooth Serial Port Profile (SPP) to communicate with the Android app. The Corvette contains an ESP32 using a Bluetooth Human Interface Device (HID) to communicate with the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.
