# esp32-bluetooth-rc-car
Problem : Two cheap RC-Cars from the supermarket are broken. The remote control is broken and the car itself is not working properly. The sensible thing to do is throw them away and buy a [proper one](https://www.verspaget.nl/t2m-pirate-booster-t4933) instead. But where is the fun in that? Let's fix it!

## Dune Buggy
The Dune Buggy is controlled by an Android app.  It contains an ESP32 using a Bluetooth Serial Port Profile (SPP).
